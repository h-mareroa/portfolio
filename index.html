          Karel Martens was my initial point of influence for this project. His enquiry into print through graphic design, as well as his playful use of colour was inspiring and unfamiliar for myself, having spent the majority of my degree online and digitally completing work.
Building on Karel Martens idea of printing on found materials, I collected documents from my parents over the years, most of which were relating to houses/land. Exploring the idea of land ownership in Aotearoa, with a focus on how Maori view the ownership of land, I played with the redaction of elements within these documents to show that. The main point of names being redacted played into the concept of no sole person ‘owning’ the whenua that is mentioned in this project.
The exploration of redaction lead to a typeface, which is displayed only with the letters used in Te Pū Taka Māori [the maori alphabet] and a poster series. The pieces are sometime difficult to put together, which builds on the narrative, which is alien and detacthed to many Maori, of how land is viewed in modern day Aotearoa compared to that in the past.
